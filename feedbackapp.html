<h3>What do you think of the feedback app?</h3>
<P>The feedback application is an easy way for us to keep track of bugs and feedback. <BR>
This app should be user-friendly and we hope it is, but it probably isn't. Go do some quests and answer<br>
these questions! :)
<BR>
<BR>
- Did you see any bugs, glitches or annoying behavior?
- Is it user-friendly?
- What would you change about this app if you could?
- Would you use this application?
<BR>
<BR>
Let us know!
<br>
Thanks,<bR>
All members of the FeatherCode team</P>
