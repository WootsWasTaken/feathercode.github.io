<h2>We need art!</h2>

<p>We almost finished our website, but it's a bit boring and weird in some ways. We also have pages <br>
which have absolutely no images, yet. We do think images are nice to have.</p>

<h3>Owls for the 404 page</h3>
<p>We have a <a href="http://feathercode.github.io/404">404 error (not found error) page</a>, as you can see it's a boring page. We need<br>
to redesign the page some time soon but we would like an owl (or more) on that page to make it nicer to look at.<br><br>

What do we want it to look like?<br>
We would like a cartoon like owl (or more). The current page has the following text: "The wise owls say you should go to the Home Page". <br>
So, you may want to make something that represents a 'wise owl'. However, this isn't a requirement. We would be happy if it was colored in but this isn't a requirement <br>
